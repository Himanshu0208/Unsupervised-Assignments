K-Means :- in this type of clustring algorithm intially there are k points genrated random now clusters are formed on the basis of distance bwteen the randomly genrated points and data points now the randomly genrate point are replaced by the mean of cluster and this goes on until a stage come when the meanof the cluster formed will be equal to the centroids of cluster\n",

Hererical Clustring - its of 2 type one is agglomarative in which we first treat each data point as a cluster then goes on by combining until only one cluster remains and the other divise in this we first select all points in one cluster then goes dividing then untill each point is itself a cluster now the number of cluster will be determined by dendogram formed.\n",
